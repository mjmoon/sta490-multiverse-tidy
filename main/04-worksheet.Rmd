## Worksheet

In this section, you will expand the multiverse analysis from the previous section and conduct the analysis on your own. We are interested in answering the question on whether soccer referees give more red cards to dark-skinned players. Suppose you decided to answer the questions by investigating the logistic model as defined below:

$$\text{logit} E(Y_{i,j,k}) = \beta X_i, \text{ where}$$
$Y_{i,j,k}$ is 1 if player $i$ receives a red card in game $k$ officiated by referee $j$ and $X_i$ represents a vector containing player $i$'s mean skin tone rating and covariates plus the interaction term. 

> At the end of the exercise, you will print the worksheet and submit a PDF file as described in *Submission instruction* at the bottom of this page.

### Multiverse setup

Suppose you are interested in all combinations of the following options. 

A.  Player's position (`position`): Consider the options discussed in _Multiverse analysis in R_ section:  
__A1.__ not including the position variable;  
__A2.__ grouping positions into fielders vs. goal keepers;  
__A3.__ grouping positions into 4 groups of forwards vs. midfielders vs. defenders vs. goal keepers; and  
__A4.__ including the position variable as is.
B.  League country<sup><a href="#note5">5</a></sup> (`leagueCountry`): The data set includes players playing in English and German leagues. It is possible that the variable is a confounder as a league may tend to give out more red cards and have more or less players with darker skin tones. On the other hand, some argue that the variable is unreliable because players move between the leagues and the data set doesn't capture the movements. Consider the following options:  
__B1.__ not including the league country variable; and  
__B2.__ using the league country variable.
C.  Player size<sup><a href="#note5">5</a></sup> (`height` or `weight`): Players that are larger may be more willing to engage in physical contacts with other players due to their physical advantage. This may lead to more red cards to larger players. You can control for a player's size using either their height or weight. Consider the options of:  
__C1.__ using the height variable to represent a player's size; and  
__C2.__ using the weight variable to represent a player's size.

### Code your own multiverse

Use the code area below to conduct the multiverse analysis that covers _all combinations of options for A, B, and C_ and answer the questions below. You can run your code by clicking the _Run code_ button on the right or with keyboard shortcuts (`Cmd + Enter` or `Ctrl + Enter` for selected lines; `Cmd + Shift + Enter` or `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` for the entire chunk). 

> If you face problems running your code in the code area, download [this starter code script](www/starter.R) and conduct the analysis locally or on [JupyterHub](http://jupyter.utoronto.ca).

> You may want to place log-odd ratio estimates, odd ratio estimates, and their confidence intervals in a single data frame and print to help answer the questions below.

The required libraries have been loaded and the `skintone` variable has been defined as below for your use in the code area.

```{r worksheet-setup-disp, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
soccer <- soccer %>%
  mutate(skintone = (rater1 + rater2) / 2)
```

```{r worksheet-setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
soccer <- soccer %>%
  mutate(skintone = (rater1 + rater2) / 2)
```

```{r worksheet, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=35, exercise.setup="worksheet-setup", exercise.eval=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE}

      shiny::showNotification(paste(q12msg), type = "error")},
    warning = function(c) {

  q14ans$ans, colnames = FALSE, width = "100%", na = "")
```


### Question 2. Expanding the multiverse

In Question 1, we limited our analysis to a subset of covariates and a generalized linear model. In Silberzahn et al. (2018), the analyst teams considered a wider range of covariates and different types of models. In particular, we did not address the dependence structure due to repeated records of players and referees. On the other hand, the teams addressed the issue with various methods including mixed models, hierarchical Bayesian models, etc. 


#### Question 2.1

```{r q21}
shiny::textAreaInput("q21universe", "Identify at least one alternative analysis that models the dependence structure of players and/or referees. For each analysis path identified, clealry specify the additional variables used and the method considered. Answer the",
                     placeholder = "(Write your answer here and click 'Add' to add your answer to the list. Click 'Reset' to reset the list of your answers.)",
                     width = "100%", height="150px", resize = "vertical")
```

```{r q21-button}
shiny::actionButton("addUniverse", "Add", icon = shiny::icon("plus", class = "fa-solid"))
shiny::actionButton("clearUniverse", "Reset", icon = shiny::icon("eraser", class = "fa-solid"))
```

##### List of options added

```{r q21-ui}
shiny::uiOutput("universeList")
```

```{r q21-server, context="server"}
inputText <- "<your answer(s) will appear here.>"
universes <- shiny::reactiveValues(universeVector = c(inputText))
shiny::observeEvent(input$addUniverse, {
  shiny::isolate(if(inputText %in% universes$universeVector) universes$universeVector <- c())
  shiny::isolate(
    universes$universeVector <- append(universes$universeVector, input$q21universe))
  shiny::isolate(
    shiny::updateTextAreaInput(
      inputId = "q21universe", value = "",
      placeholder = "(Write your answer here and click 'Add' to add more analysis options. Click 'Reset' to reset the list of your answers.)"))
})
shiny::observeEvent(input$clearUniverse, {
  shiny::isolate(universes$universeVector <- c(inputText))
  shiny::isolate(
    shiny::updateTextAreaInput(
      inputId = "q21universe", value = "",
      placeholder = "(Write your answer here and click 'Add' to add your answer to the list. Click 'Reset' to reset the list of your answers.)"))
})
output$universeList <- shiny::renderTable(
  universes$universeVector, striped = TRUE, width = "100%", colnames = FALSE)
```

#### Question 2.2

```{r q22}
shiny::numericInput("q22", "When you expand the multiverse from Question 1 with the options you listed in Question 2.1, how many universes does the multiverse analysis include in total?", 
                    value = 0, min = 0, step = 1)
shiny::actionButton("q22btn", "Confirm")
shiny::div("Your answer: ", shiny::textOutput("q22ans", inline = TRUE), 
           style = "width: 100%; display: inline-block; font-weight: 700;") 
```

```{r q22-server, context="server"}
q22ans <- shiny::reactiveValues(ans = 0)
shiny::observeEvent(input$q22btn, {shiny::isolate(q22ans$ans <- input$q22) })
output$q22ans <- shiny::renderText(paste0(q22ans$ans, " universes."))
```


### Question 3. Discussion

For Question 3, reflect on the multiverse analysis conducted in Question 1. 

```{r q31}
shiny::textAreaInput("q31", "In comparison to a single-universe analysis, what are some benefits of a multiverse analysis?",
                     placeholder = "(Write your answer here.)",
                     width = "100%", height="150px", resize = "vertical")
shiny::actionButton("q31btn", "Confirm")
shiny::div("Your answer: ", 
           style = "width: 100%; display: inline-block; font-weight: 700;") 
shiny::uiOutput("q31ans")
```

```{r q31-server, context="server"}
q31ans <- shiny::reactiveValues(ans = "")
shiny::observeEvent(input$q31btn, {shiny::isolate( q31ans$ans <- input$q31 )})
output$q31ans <- shiny::renderTable(
  q31ans$ans, colnames = FALSE, width = "100%", na = "")
```

```{r q32}
shiny::textAreaInput("q32", "In comparison to a single-universe analysis, what are some challenges of a multiverse analysis?",
                     placeholder = "(Write your answer here.)",
                     width = "100%", height="150px", resize = "vertical")
shiny::actionButton("q32btn", "Confirm")
shiny::div("Your answer: ", 
           style = "width: 100%; display: inline-block; font-weight: 700;") 
shiny::uiOutput("q32ans")
```

```{r q32-server, context="server"}
q32ans <- shiny::reactiveValues(ans = "")
shiny::observeEvent(input$q32btn, {shiny::isolate( q32ans$ans <- input$q32 )})
output$q32ans <- shiny::renderTable(
  q32ans$ans, colnames = FALSE, width = "100%", na = "")
```
